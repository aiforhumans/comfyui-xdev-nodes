```

## Development Workflows

### **Rapid Prototyping**
1. Set up basic system instruction
2. Test with simple prompts
3. Iterate on system instruction based on responses
4. Adjust temperature for desired creativity level
5. Monitor request tracking for optimization

### **A/B Testing**
- Use multiple LLM-DEV Framework nodes with different system instructions
- Same prompt, different approaches
- Compare responses and request details
- Optimize based on results

### **Error Debugging**
- Check request_made output for detailed error information
- Verify server URL and model name
- Monitor generation statistics for performance issues
- Use validation to catch input problems early

### **Performance Testing**
- Test with different token limits
- Monitor generation times in request tracking
- Compare different temperature settings
- Evaluate response quality vs speed

## Best Practices

### **System Instruction Design**
1. **Be Specific**: Clearly define the LLM's role and expertise
2. **Set Tone**: Specify desired response style (formal, casual, technical)
3. **Include Guidelines**: Mention format preferences, length constraints
4. **Add Context**: Provide background information if needed

### **Prompt Engineering**
1. **Clear Objectives**: State exactly what you want
2. **Provide Context**: Include necessary background information
3. **Specify Format**: Request specific output formats if needed
4. **Use Examples**: Include examples for complex requests

### **Configuration Tips**
1. **Start Conservative**: Use lower temperature (0.3-0.5) for consistent results
2. **Iterate Gradually**: Make small changes and test
3. **Monitor Outputs**: Use request tracking to understand what's happening
4. **Test Edge Cases**: Try unusual inputs to verify robustness

### **Integration Patterns**
- **Chain with Other Nodes**: Use response as input to prompt tools
- **Loop for Iteration**: Use request tracking to refine approaches
- **Parallel Testing**: Multiple nodes for comparison
- **Error Handling**: Enable validation for production workflows

## Troubleshooting

### **Common Issues**

#### **No Response / Errors**
- Check server URL is correct and server is running
- Verify model name matches loaded model in LM Studio
- Check request_made output for specific error details
- Ensure system instruction and prompt are not empty

#### **Poor Quality Responses**
- Refine system instruction to be more specific
- Adjust temperature (lower for consistency, higher for creativity)
- Provide more context in prompts
- Check if model is appropriate for the task

#### **Slow Performance**
- Reduce max_tokens for shorter responses
- Lower temperature slightly (can improve generation speed)
- Check server performance and available resources
- Monitor generation statistics in request tracking

#### **Inconsistent Results**
- Lower temperature for more predictable outputs
- Use more specific system instructions
- Provide consistent prompt formatting
- Check for model loading issues in LM Studio

## Advanced Usage

### **Custom System Roles**
Create specialized system instructions for different use cases:
- **Code Reviewer**: "You are an expert code reviewer. Analyze code for bugs, security issues, and best practices."
- **API Documentation**: "You are an API documentation generator. Create clear, comprehensive API docs from code."
- **Test Generator**: "You are a test case generator. Create comprehensive unit tests for given code."

### **Multi-Step Workflows**
1. **Planning Node**: Generate project plans or approaches
2. **Implementation Node**: Create actual code or content
3. **Review Node**: Analyze and improve the implementation
4. **Documentation Node**: Generate documentation

### **Quality Control**
- Use request tracking to build performance baselines
- Compare different models with same prompts
- Track response quality over time
- Implement automated testing with expected outputs

The **LLM-DEV Framework** provides a clean, development-focused interface for LLM integration that prioritizes rapid iteration, debugging visibility, and practical usage patterns.
