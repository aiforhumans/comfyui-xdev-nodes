## Expert System Prompt

The node uses a specialized system prompt that:

1. **Analyzes** USER_PROMPT + STYLE_SETTINGS + RULES
2. **Extracts** core subject/scene from USER_PROMPT
3. **Applies** STYLE_SETTINGS for visual direction
4. **Integrates** RULES as constraints and quality guidelines
5. **Optimizes** for SDXL model performance

### **Prompt Structure Priority**:
1. Main subject (from USER_PROMPT)
2. Key descriptors (physical, emotional)
3. Style/mood elements (from STYLE_SETTINGS)
4. Technical quality (from RULES)
5. Lighting/composition details
6. Camera/lens specifications if relevant

## Configuration Options

### **Temperature** (0.0-2.0, default: 0.3)
- **Low (0.0-0.3)**: More consistent, predictable results
- **Medium (0.4-0.7)**: Balanced creativity and structure
- **High (0.8-2.0)**: More creative variations

### **Max Tokens** (100-4096, default: 800)
- Controls response length
- 800 tokens is optimal for concise SDXL prompts
- Lower values for very brief prompts
- Higher values for detailed descriptions

### **Fallback Support**
- Automatically generates basic prompt if LLM fails
- Combines inputs intelligently
- Includes quality terms from RULES
- Ensures workflow continues even on errors

## Usage Examples

### **Example 1: Cozy Portrait**
```
USER_PROMPT: "young woman reading by a window"
STYLE_SETTINGS: "natural lighting, soft colors, cozy atmosphere, golden hour" 
RULES: "photorealistic, high quality, detailed, no anime style"

Output: "young woman reading book by large window, soft natural lighting, golden hour glow, cozy atmosphere, warm colors, peaceful expression, detailed facial features, photorealistic, high quality"
```

### **Example 2: Cyberpunk Scene**
```
USER_PROMPT: "cyberpunk street scene at night"
STYLE_SETTINGS: "neon lighting, urban decay, futuristic elements, rain reflections"
RULES: "cinematic quality, high contrast, no cartoons"

Output: "cyberpunk street scene at night, neon lighting, urban decay, futuristic elements, rain-soaked pavement with reflections, high contrast lighting, cinematic quality, detailed architecture"
```

### **Example 3: Professional Portrait**
