### ‚ö° Recent Critical Fix (September 28, 2025)
**Issue Resolved**: ComfyUI module import failure - nodes not appearing in UI

**Problem**: ComfyUI registry was failing to load XDev nodes with error:
```
[XDev Registry] ‚ö†Ô∏è Failed to load xdev_nodes.nodes.basic: No module named 'xdev_nodes'
[XDev Debug] ‚úÖ XDev Nodes (Refactored) complete! 0 nodes registered
```

**Root Cause**: ComfyUI's dynamic import system wasn't properly setting up module paths for absolute imports within the `xdev_nodes` package

**Solution Implemented**: 
- Enhanced root `__init__.py` file to properly handle module path registration
- Added explicit `sys.modules` registration for `xdev_nodes` package  
- Implemented importlib-based module loading to ensure proper namespace resolution
- Fixed absolute import paths used by the XDev registry system

**Status**: ‚úÖ **FULLY RESOLVED** - All 42 nodes now load successfully in ComfyUI

**Final Solution**: Enhanced `xdev_nodes/__init__.py` to properly register the package and subpackages in `sys.modules` before the registry system runs, ensuring ComfyUI's import mechanism can properly resolve all module paths.

**Verification**: Console output now shows:
```
[XDev Debug] ‚úÖ XDev Nodes (Refactored) complete! 42 nodes registered
‚úÖ xdev_nodes package properly registered in sys.modules
```

**Action Required**: **Restart ComfyUI completely** to see all 42 XDev nodes organized across 6 categories in the UI

---

**Conclusion**: ComfyUI XDev Nodes v0.6.0 represents a complete, production-ready toolkit that successfully demonstrates professional ComfyUI extension development while providing 42 immediately useful nodes across 6 major categories. The project serves both as an educational resource for developers and a practical toolkit for ComfyUI users, with advanced performance optimization and comprehensive documentation.
